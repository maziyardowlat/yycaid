          sort which could only be broken by
          love's first kiss. She was locked
          away in a castle guarded by a
          terrible fire-breathing dragon.

          free her from this dreadful prison,

          room of the tallest tower for her
          true love and true love's first
          kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever
